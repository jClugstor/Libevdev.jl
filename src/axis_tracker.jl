    AxisTracker

A background-pumped view of an input device's current axis state,
designed for high-rate polling from any task.

A tracker spawns a `Threads.@spawn` watcher task that drains events
from the underlying [`EvdevDevice`](@ref) and updates atomic slots for
two event classes:

- **`EV_ABS` (absolute axes)** — each slot holds the *latest reported
  value*, overwritten on every event. Use for joystick positions,
  touch coordinates, tablet pen pressure.
- **`EV_REL` (relative axes)** — each slot holds the *cumulative sum
  of deltas* since the tracker was constructed (or the slot was last
  consumed). Use for mouse motion, scroll wheel ticks.

All queries are lock-free atomic loads, so callers can poll at any
rate without contending with the watcher or each other.

# Lifecycle
Construct with [`AxisTracker(path)`](@ref) or
[`AxisTracker(dev; own)`](@ref). Always [`close`](@ref) when done. The
GC finalizer also closes the tracker.

# Absolute-axis API
- Latest value of one axis: [`axis`](@ref).
- Snapshot of all axes: [`axis_values`](@ref).
- Static range metadata: [`axis_range`](@ref), [`axis_codes`](@ref).

# Relative-axis API
- Cumulative delta on one axis: [`rel`](@ref).
- Snapshot of all relative axes: [`rel_values`](@ref).
- Codes followed: [`rel_codes`](@ref).
- Consume-and-reset (read the delta since last consume): [`consume_rel!`](@ref), [`consume_rel_values!`](@ref).

# Limitations
Multi-touch (`MT_*`) axes are tracked, but values are conflated across
touch slots — the tracker keeps one slot per code. For per-touch
state, drive the slot API on the underlying device directly.

Wrap an open device and start a background pump task that tracks every

# Arguments
- `dev`: an open [`EvdevDevice`](@ref).
- `own`: when `true`, the tracker takes ownership of `dev` and will

  retains ownership and is responsible for closing `dev` after the
  tracker.

Each axis slot is seeded with libevdev's *cached* current value at
construction time. For axes the device hasn't reported a position for
yet (most absolute devices are quiescent until the first user input),
that cached value will be `0`. The first real event updates the slot.
