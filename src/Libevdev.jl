# Library handle for ccalls in the wrapper layer. Imported under an
# unambiguous name because both `LibevdevRaw.libevdev` (the opaque
# struct type) and `libevdev_jll.libevdev` (the .so path) exist in
# different scopes — a bare `libevdev` symbol is the wrong one in
# either direction.
# A `const` and not a `using ... as`: with this JLLWrappers generation the
# binding `libevdev_jll.libevdev` is a plain global that `__init__` fills, so a
# ccall through it looks the path up at run time. A `juliac --trim` executable
# has no `getproperty(::Module, ::Symbol)` for that and dies at the first
# encoder read. The constant captures the resolved path when this module
# precompiles (the same pattern as `const libpio = PIOLib_jll.libpio`).

# Parse the kernel input headers at precompile time and define matching
# `const` bindings (EV_*, KEY_*, BTN_*, ABS_*, FF_*, MT_TOOL_*, BUS_*,
# ID_*, ...) directly in this module. `include_dependency` makes Julia
# rebuild the precompile cache whenever a header changes — e.g. after a
# kernel-headers upgrade. No Clang.jl involvement: this is a pure regex
# + Meta.parse pass over ~1300 lines of C across two headers.

# Constants the wrapper code in this module references directly. The

# parser; any failure surfaces at module load with the exact missing

        package, replace the bundled fallback at `deps/`, or point
        Libevdev at a known-good copy via the JULIA_LIBEVDEV_KERNEL_HEADERS
        environment variable.
